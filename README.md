### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning NODE JS. I'm really liking this server side deal. All the pieces coming together. I wonder if I'll have to grow out my mustache again cause I'm using mustache . . . 

- [Linked-In](https://www.linkedin.com/in/agentlopez/) You know, because let money = 1000000000000 doesn't work.
